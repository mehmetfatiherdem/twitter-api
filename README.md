# Twitter API Clone

This is an attempt of me making a Twitter backend clone
in order to improve my Java/Spring skills.

### Note: This is still an ongoing project. What you see here is not the finalized version of the project.

## About The Project

I started this project right after I made a typical [Todo App](https://github.com/mehmetfatiherdem/hello-spring) to get started with the Spring framework. I already had experience in backend development with NodeJS and I did not want to spend tons of time on following tutorials so, I wanted to take a big challenge to learn Spring framework. It is built on top of the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
